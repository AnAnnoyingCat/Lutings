#david The common Bean, also known as Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous plant grown worldwide for its edible dry seeds or green, unripe pods. When provided with a lute it has been observed to evolve into Luting, which in term evolves into BEANING
at level 15 OOOO
with a rare chance of 2? percent.

#david Here we are currently observing a wild bleb specimen. We nicknamed it "Jellycopter". Observe its behaviour. Blebs require exquisite mental stimulation in order to develop properly. Therefore specimen #15, "Jellycopter", took to
creating toys for his fellow blebs in order to ensure proper mental development. Blebs have shown to greatly enjoy music
and fresh klim, so we rewarded his behaviour with klim. Truly fascinating how much this particular pack of blebs has evolved. Cheer1

#david On today's episode of bleb world we will be looking at a true enigma of a number. The number in question is none other, than 15. The eighth composite number and the sixth semiprime. It is also the largest 4-bit unsigned number. 4 bits? 2? times 2? bits. Coincidence? Well, I, for one, think not. In blebism, the official religion of glorpistan, it signifies "wholeness" or "completeness", as it can often be seen depicted on religious paintings and murals. Truly fascinating indeed.

#david On today's episode of bleb world we will be looking at a truly fascinating religion. Blebism is a Klimmonian monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of barryChrist . In Blebism, the cow is holy, for it makes klim, and klim represents the blood of barryChrist . The number 15 is often seen depicted in murals, as it represents the number of COCKA of barryChrist. Thus, having 15 OOOO Bean statues in your home would be said to bring luck, good harvest and fertility.

#david Urine and feces are the cologne of the hippo world. To impress female hippos, males don't just defecate and urinate near them; they use spinning tails and some of the most powerful farts on earth to fling the mess far and wide, to make sure all the females in the area can smell it. If he catches a female's interest, she'll raise her rear up out of the water to show she's ready to reciprocateâ€¦ by showering him in dung. Scientists call this "submissive defecation."

#obiwan come, my grandson, drink your klim. yes, go on, drink all of it so you'll grow tall and strong like mr streamer some day.
