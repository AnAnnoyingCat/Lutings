#david The common Bean, also known as Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous plant grown worldwide for its edible dry seeds or green, unripe pods. When provided with a lute it has been observed to evolve into Luting, which in term evolves into BEANINGat level 15 OOOO with a rare chance of 2? percent.

#david Here we are currently observing a wild bleb specimen. We nicknamed it "Jellycopter". Observe its behaviour. Blebs require exquisite mental stimulation in order to develop properly. Therefore specimen #15, "Jellycopter", took to creating toys for his fellow blebs in order to ensure proper mental development. Blebs have shown to greatly enjoy music and fresh klim, so we rewarded his behaviour with klim. Truly fascinating how much this particular pack of blebs has evolved.

#david Here we are currently observing a wild bleb specimen. We nicknamed this one "Thom". Observe its behaviour. Blebs have shown great affection to rhymes, so this one has specialized in talking in rhymes. specimen number 2? Thom is truly a perplexing bleb indeed. let's reward it with some klim

#david On today's episode of bleb world we will be looking at a true enigma of a number. The number in question is none other, than 15. The eighth composite number and the sixth semiprime. It is also the largest 4-bit unsigned number. 4 bits? 2? times 2? bits. Coincidence? Well, I, for one, think not. In blebism, the official religion of glorpistan, it signifies "wholeness" or "completeness", as it can often be seen depicted on religious paintings and murals. Truly fascinating indeed.

#david On today's episode of bleb world we will be looking at a truly fascinating religion. Blebism is a Klimmonian monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of barryChrist . In Blebism, the cow is holy, for it makes klim, and klim represents the blood of barryChrist . The number 15 is often seen depicted in murals, as it represents the number of COCKA of barryChrist. Thus, having 15 OOOO Bean statues in your home would be said to bring luck, good harvest and fertility.

#david Urine and feces are the cologne of the hippo world. To impress female hippos, males don't just defecate and urinate near them; they use spinning tails and some of the most powerful farts on earth to fling the mess far and wide, to make sure all the females in the area can smell it. If he catches a female's interest, she'll raise her rear up out of the water to show she's ready to reciprocateâ€¦ by showering him in dung. Scientists call this "submissive defecation."

#obiwan come, my grandson, drink your klim. yes, go on, drink all of it so you'll grow tall and strong like mr streamer some day. 

#david this is, some truly most exquisite tea you prepared for me, my dear friend. pray tell what is your secret to it? #obiwan dearest david, whenever i make my tea, i make sure to put a little bit of klim in it

#obiwan these youths with their lutings, confusing poor people like me with things they call "GTA" and geometry dash. truly outrageous

#david look at this elusive bleb specimen. this one we call "Athena". Specimen Athena has constructed a truly complicated cofounding contraption so incredibly ingenious and chaotically complex it is truly bewildering. This machine magically tells a number, very central to blebism, every day. blebs have been observed chanting the number every day, and we believe it is a ritual for good luck. Scientists' leading current theory is the blebs see Athena as a god, though this may be wrong.

#david the number 15 is often believed to represent either the number of COCKA of barryChrist, the length in cm, or the length in inches. In old greece the cm interpretation was most common, so old greek statues had very average sized COCKA . In Ireland the believe of 15 COCKA prevails to this day, so people keep 15 Bean statues in their home. the Bean signifies the phallus and happiness. in other parts of europe, barryChrist is often depicted as having one huge, absolutely massive, cock.

#david observe this one. specimen #69. it displays some most unique properties. specimen 69, "harry" appears to serve as a leader to the pack. it displays unparalleled smartness and could be considered an intellectual among the blebs. scientists argue about classifying it as 'not a bleb' due to its intelligence, great looks, and enormous COCKA .


#david This bleb specimen we nicknamed "Pito". It is one of the musically talented ones, however, its fellow blebs have been observed to blame it a lot for seemingly unrelated things. Nontheless, it appears to be a very well liked individual among the blebs. Let's observe its talent in practice. Hey, Pito, yes yes come here little one. Here's some klim, just for you. Would you like to show the people what you always do with the lute?

#trump help. help. no, i'm not stuck. just examining the washing machine for quality. great washing machine, perhaps the best. #obiwan step-trump, what are you doing there? need some help? wink, wink #lute 328 ido0a7/2a/2r2a2r2a2|ido3r4c2r6c4|ido5c16|idv3o4t2rcrcv2av3c

#obiwan son, son, son. back in my day, we still knew how to respect klim. yeah, you heard me, none of this pussy ass "oh, klim is nice, i'll just drink a lil glass". no, son, we used to have entire klim-parties. so much wite stuff. and i'm not talking about a gangbang. we'd all drink a liter of klim together and sing songs. and then we made bogLove .

#david at just the age of 15 months, the bleb comes of age and has to fend for itself. bleb life truly is a miraculous adventure filled with Bean , Luting , and lots of bogLove .

#david Something truly spectacular has happened. the elusive "BarryHarry" was sighted in this very desert village. let's interview some of the locals. #obiwan he just entered my house, ate my bean and my bread, slept in my bed and then fucking stole it.

A septic tank is an underground chamber made of plastic through which domestic wastewater (sewage) flows for basic sewage treatment. Settling and anaerobic digestion processes reduce solids and organics, which basically makes it one big jenkim Cheer1 

#david today on bleb world we're looking at bleb mating behaviour. usually the bleb does a bogCheck before a BOGEAT followed by passionate bogLove. let's observe. #lute 328 ido0a7/2a/2r2a2r2a2|ido3r4c2r6c4|ido5c16|idv3o4t2rcrcv2av3c Cheer1
