#david The common Bean, also known as Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous plant grown worldwide for its edible dry seeds or green, unripe pods. When provided with a lute it has been observed to evolve into Luting, which in term evolves into BEANING
at level 15 OOOO
with a rare chance of 2? percent.

#david Here we are currently observing a wild bleb specimen. We nicknamed it "Jellycopter". Observe its behaviour. Blebs require exquisite mental stimulation in order to develop properly. Therefore specimen #15, "Jellycopter", took to
creating toys for his fellow blebs in order to ensure proper mental development. Blebs have shown to greatly enjoy music
and fresh klim, so we rewarded his behaviour with klim. Truly fascinating how much this particular pack of blebs has evolved. Cheer1
